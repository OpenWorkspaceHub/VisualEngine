# OpenWorkspace

We build the open source software you need for your business.

## Run VisualEngine powered repositories

The most powerful software is powered by VisualEngine. VisualEngine needs some requirements to build software as simple packages.

### Windows

Download [VisualEngine](https://visual-engine.renderforestsites.com/downloads) on your machine

After you finished the setup you need to open [terminal](https://visual-engine.com/terminal)

Enter `vs -install <path>` and replace `<path>` with the path you want to install it

> You can only use storage paths like `C:/`

### Linux
